I am an aspiring computational social scientist with a research and teaching focus on the applications of artificial intelligence in scientific knowledge production and humanities scholarship. Following more than a decade of publishing in institutional and evolutionary economics, I began developing advanced data analysis skills through Python programming. I am currently leading a project that documents over 700 economists, translators, and scholars who have shaped economic thought in the Republic of Türkiye and the Ottoman Empire since the 1800s. Together with my colleagues, we curate comprehensive biographical, bibliographical, and textual datasets, which we use to power a range of AI tools for analysis, visualization, and automated essay generation.

I'm also an independent singer and songwriter who enjoys creating melodies with simple chords on acoustic guitar. My musical journey began in the 1990s when I explored the rich traditions of Turkish folk music alongside progressive rock. Today, I find inspiration in minimalist electronic music from around the globe. I experiment with computerized tools to produce and record demo songs in my home studio.
